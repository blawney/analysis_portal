workflow:

user register a project
	-on backend, reads project directory, puts those in BaseSample table

when user 'creates analysis'
	- initiate a Analysis object
	- populate with user, project, and a common name (for their use more than anything)
	- automatically populate the AnalysisSample table with the samples for this project, user, etc.
